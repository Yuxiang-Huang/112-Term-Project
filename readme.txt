# 15-112-Term-Project

## Project Description

The name of my term project is Rail Control. This is a traffic control game where the player needs to control the rails to ensure that the cars can safely reach their destination. The game will start with a random map of different types of rails and destinations. The player will interact with the game by changing the direction of the rails by clicking them. Different types of cars will spawn from the edge of the map. The player will win points if a car successfully reaches its corresponding destination and lose points if two cars crash into each other.

## How to Run the Project

The user should run main.py in an editor.
